5. Commit the file

## Alternative: Use Railway's Python Buildpack

If `nixpacks.toml` doesn't work, let's try a different approach.

### Click "View logs" to see the full error

Can you click **"View logs"** on the failed deployment and share what you see? This will tell us exactly what Railway is struggling with.

## Or Try: Procfile Instead

Some platforms prefer a `Procfile`. Create this file:

**Filename:** `Procfile` (no extension)
**Content:**
```
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## Quick Checklist

Make sure your repo has these files:
```
Justrite_Romania/
├── main.py              # Your FastAPI app
├── requirements.txt     # Python packages
├── runtime.txt          # python-3.11.7
├── nixpacks.toml        # ← Add this
└── Procfile             # ← Or add this
