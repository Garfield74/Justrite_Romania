**Why these changes?**
- Newer versions are compatible with all Python versions
- Pre-built wheels available (no Rust compilation needed)
- More stable and tested

## Alternative: Quick Fix (Use Pre-built Wheels)

If you want to keep your current package versions, just fix the Python version:

### Create `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.11.7
```

This tells Render to use Python 3.11 instead of 3.14, which has better package compatibility.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Option A: Just Fix Python Version (Easiest)

1. **Add `runtime.txt` to your repo:**
   - File name: `runtime.txt`
   - Content: `python-3.11.7`

2. **Commit and push**

3. **Render will auto-redeploy** with Python 3.11

### Option B: Fix Python + Update Packages (Recommended)

1. **Add `runtime.txt`:**
```
   python-3.11.7
